In myRecipe.js file I used the animate method to slowly toggle when the user selects the h3 elements. 
I used "//$("h3").click(display);" to keep the display 2 from showing when the user clicks the h3 elements.
I used the "hover" function to change the background color when the mouse is hovered over it. 
I changed the colors of the h3 element background to red and blue.
